# Adding Stuff to Backend

You only need to modify the `config.py` file. **DO NOT CHANGE CODE** in the `app.py` file as it is already configured to work dynamically with the frontend. 

To add custom strategies, update the mappings dictionary in `config.py` and define how you want them displayed on the frontend, all within the `config.py` file.
